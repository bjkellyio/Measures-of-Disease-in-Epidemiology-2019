## Disclosures &lt;hr/&gt;

- No conflicts of interest.

- Too many topics covered.

- May contain GIFs.

Notes from John:

c.       I think we should use the term "Risk Difference" instead of "Absolute risk reduction."  This should always be "Ie-Iu" but in one of the examples in the lecture, it's reversed and it's presented as "Iu-Ie" which was confusing to them.  We could also define both terms and say RD=Ie-Iu and then absolute risk reduction has to do with the way in which the question is phrased (i.e., improvement is a good outcome or adverse event where the outcome is bad).

d.       Calculating annual cumulative incidence on slides 23-24; I think the answer given during lecture was 0.3 but I think it should actually be 0.15.  This was confusing to them (and me).

## Learning Objectives &lt;hr/&gt;

- How we measure: describe types of data and data distributions.

- Measures of disease occurrence: use population data in the description of health and disease.

- Key concepts -- explain the meaning of:

    - prevalence
    - incidence (&lt;ins&gt;warning&lt;/ins&gt;: multiple types)
    - relative risk (RR)
    - odds ratio (OR)

- Implementation: calculate prevalence, incidence, RR, and OR from study data (2x2 tables!).


---

## Why Do I Care? ... &lt;hr/&gt;

- Why use these tools (prevalence, incidence, RR, OR)?

     - inform differential diagnoses &amp; counsel patients (&lt;ins&gt;your job&lt;/ins&gt;)  
     
     - design public health interventions &amp; direct new diagnostics/therapies (society!)   
     
     - understand distributions and determinants of diseases (science!)  


---

## ... What Do I Need to Know for the Test? &lt;hr/&gt;

- How to use these tools:

     - precise definitions 
     (e.g., RR vs OR, cumulative incidence vs incidence density)  
     
     - a bit of arithmetic

_All the above observations suggest the possibility of a &lt;mark&gt;cellular-immune dysfunction related to a common exposure that predisposes individuals to opportunistic infections such as pneumocystosis and candidiasis&lt;/mark&gt;. Although the role of CMV infection in the pathogenesis of pneumocystosis remains unknown, the possibility of_ P. carinii _infection must be carefully considered in a differential diagnosis for previously healthy homosexual males with dyspnea and pneumonia._

## A case from 1981... _Pneumocystis_ pneumonia? &lt;hr/&gt;

- 36-year-old man presents with a 4-month history of fever, dyspnea, and cough.

- What do you want to know and why?  

    - history
    - vital signs
    - physical exam
    - laboratory test values
    - radiology  

- What is his diagnosis? Does he have _Pneumocystis_ pneumonia?


---

## A case from 1981... _Pneumocystis_ pneumonia? &lt;hr/&gt;

- Differential diagnosis must be grounded in understanding:

    - distributions of disease: we'll learn about **prevalence** &amp; **incidence**  
    
    - determinants of disease: we'll learn **2x2 tables** to relate exposures and outcomes  
  
- In 1981, _Pneumocystis_ was known to be a low &lt;ins&gt;prevalence&lt;/ins&gt; disease.

- New data would show an increasing &lt;ins&gt;incidence&lt;/ins&gt;. (In ID, the differential is always evolving).  
  



---

## A case from 1981... _Pneumocystis_ pneumonia? &lt;hr/&gt;

- Does our patient have _Pneumocystis_ pneumonia?

- How is the distribution of _Pneumocystis_ pneumonia changing?

- What are the determinants of _Pneumocystis_ pneumonia?
  
&lt;br/&gt;
  
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt; &lt;mark&gt;Note: questions depend on &lt;strong&gt;dichotomous&lt;/strong&gt; definition of disease (yes/no &lt;em&gt;Pneumocystis&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/mark&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

# Data Types &amp; Data Distributions



---

## Data Types &lt;hr/&gt;

- Vital signs and physical exam:

    - temperature (degrees) - continuous
    - heart / respiratory rate (beats or breaths / min) - continuous
    - oxygen saturation (%) - continuous

- Laboratory values:

    - white blood cell count (cells / uL) - continuous
    - *if it weren't 1981... CD4 cell count (cells / uL) and HIV viral load (copies / mL) - continuous*

- Radiology:

    - ground glass - dichotomous



---

## Data Types &lt;hr/&gt;

- __Dichotomous__: history of diabetes, history of breast cancer; survival, pneumonia, MI

- __Continuous__: age, height, weight, blood pressure; probability of treatment result

- __Nominal__: race, ethnicity, state of residence

- __Ordinal__: age category, weight category; patient satisfaction
  
  
  
---

## Characterizing Continuous Data: Normal &lt;hr/&gt;

- "Normally distributed" data are well characterized by their mean and standard deviation.

    - **mean ( `\(\mu\)`)**:
`$$\mu=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^Nx_i$$`

    - **standard deviation (SD or `\(\sigma\)`)**:
`$$\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}*\sum_{i=1}^N(x_i - \mu)^2}$$`
  
&lt;br/&gt;
  
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt; (you do &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; need to memorize these formulas) &lt;/p&gt;



---

## Characterizing Continuous Data: Normal &lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;img src="measures_of_disease_in_epidemiology_2019_bjk_files/figure-html/continuous_data-1.png" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

.footnote[[*] Data made up.]



---

## Reflection Question &lt;hr/&gt;

What makes standard deviation greater?

- (A) More subjects?

- (B) Higher mean value?

- (C) Higher maximum value?

- (D) Greater difference between extreme and mean values? 



---

## Characterizing Continuous Data: Skewed or Uniform &lt;hr/&gt;

- “Non-parametric” data have a mean and standard deviation, but these parameters do NOT characterize the data well:  

    - **skewed** data: distrubtion not symmetric around a central value  
    
    - **uniform** data: distributed with equal probability of each value across whole range of values  

- For uniform or skewed data, we prefer to use **median** and **interquartile range (IQR)** to describe the distribution of a continuous variable because these are less affected by extreme values. 
  
- For normal data, mean and median have the same value.

## Characterizing Continuous Data: Skewed or Uniform &lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;img src="measures_of_disease_in_epidemiology_2019_bjk_files/figure-html/skewed_data-1.png" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

.footnote[[*] Data made up.]




---

## Characterizing Continuous Data &lt;hr/&gt;

- Median and mode depend on ranking the values:

    - median is the “middle value” when data are ordered / ranked 
    - mode is most frequently occurring value  
    

- Interquartile range (IQR) also depends on ranking the values:

    - the first quartile is the "middle" value of the first half of the ordered set
    - the third quartile is the "middle" value of the second half of the ordered set
    - IQR is the range of values between first and third quartiles  



---

## Reflection Question &lt;hr/&gt;

Which is least affected by outliers?

- (A) Mean?

- (B) Median?

- (C) Mode?



---

## How to Characterize Continuous Data &lt;hr/&gt;

- Pair a measure of central tendency with a measure of dispersion:

    - mean and SD (both affected by outliers)  
    
    - median and IQR  

- In doing so, account for &lt;ins&gt;uncertainty&lt;/ins&gt; in measures.  



---

## Dichotomizing Continuous Data &lt;hr/&gt;
  
- Remember the diagnosis lecture: threshold of oxygen saturation (or \beta-D glucan) to diagnose _Pneumocystis_ pneumonia means trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.

- Using a threshold to transform continuous data into dichotomous data means &lt;mark&gt;losing information about uncertainty&lt;/mark&gt;.  

- This is on top of the fundamental uncertainty we face with any epidemiologic measure: does the measured population represent the population of interest?  
  
  
---

## Dichotomania &lt;hr/&gt;

- As we discuss prevalence, incidence, RR, and OR, we will focus on &lt;ins&gt;dichotomous&lt;/ins&gt; exposures and outcomes.

- Remember -- with dichotomous data:

    - information about uncertainty is lost  
    
    - misclassification is a risk  

- But we're doing it anyway &amp;#x1F600; ... why?

- Medicine focuses on dichotomous diagnostic and treatment decisions.

# Measures of Disease Occurrence:
# Prevalence



---

## Prevalence &lt;hr/&gt;

- How common is _Pneumocystis_ pneumonia?

- Prevalence: 

    - number with the disease / number in specified population  
    
    - **point prevalence**: at a specific point in time  
    
    - **period prevalence**: during a given period (e.g., 12-month prevalence)  
    
    - a proportion (unitless, ranges from 0-1)  
    
    - numerator includes all people who have the disease, both new and ongoing cases  
    
    - represents a &lt;ins&gt;cross-sectional&lt;/ins&gt; “snapshot” of the population



---

## Prevalence of _Pneumocystis_ pneumonia &lt;hr/&gt;

- In 1967, CDC became the sole supplier of pentamidine in the United States and began collecting data on cases of PCP:

    - period prevalence published in 1974&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;: 579 cases (194 confirmed) over 3 years
    - what’s the denominator?
    - what’s the prevalence?

- __Point prevalence__ of _Pneumocystis_ would be vanishingly small given limited duration of disease.

- From 1967-1974, even the __period prevalence__ was very small.

.footnote[[*] Walzer PD et al _Annals Int Med_ 1974]



---

## Point Prevalence versus Period Prevalence &lt;hr/&gt;

- To understand the difference between point and period prevalence, let's imagine a cohort of people living with HIV/AIDS at risk for _Pneumocystis_:  

    - 50 high-risk subjects enrolled at the start of a two-year observation period  
    
    - cases of PCP each receive 3 weeks of antibiotic treatment (red dots and lines on plots)  
    
    - incomplete follow-up (abbreviated grey lines on plot)
    
    - towards end of study, some subjects started on _Pneumocystis_ prophylaxis (blue lines on plot)

## Cohort of Patients at Risk for _Pneumocystis_: Point Prevalence &lt;hr/&gt;

## Cohort of Patients at Risk for _Pneumocystis_: Period Prevalence &lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;img src="measures_of_disease_in_epidemiology_2019_bjk_files/figure-html/pcp_period_prev-1.png" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



---

## Prevalence &lt;hr/&gt;

- Prevalence is **NOT** the same as risk.

- Prevalence numerator includes all people who have the disease, both new and ongoing cases, so represents a cross-sectional “snapshot” of the population. 

- Prevalence does **NOT** estimate the risk of developing the disease because &lt;mark&gt;prevalence does **NOT** fully account for time &lt;/mark&gt; (are the measured cases old cases or new cases?).



---

## Reflection Question &lt;hr/&gt;

How can an infection have high prevalence if it occurs infrequently?

- (A) the infection is rapidly fatal

- (B) the infection rapidly resolves

- (C) a few children get the infection every year, but the infection persists for the rest of their lives

- (D) the infection results in lifelong protective immunity

    - CMV
    - _Candida_
    - Kaposi's sarcoma  

]

.footnote[[1,2] Masur H et al _NEJM_ 1981; Gottlieb MS et al _MMWR_ 1981]



---

## Incidence &lt;hr/&gt;

- Among MSM, _Pneumocystis_ pneumonia is occurring more frequently...

- Incidence: occurrence of new cases over a given period of time:

    - **cumulative incidence**: # new cases / # population at risk @ start time interval  
    
    - **incidence density**: # new cases / person-time at risk (more precise)

---

## Cumulative Incidence &lt;hr/&gt;

- Cumulative incidence:

    - must specify population consisting of at-risk individuals  
    
    - must specify a time period of observation  
    
    - &lt;ins&gt;numerator&lt;/ins&gt; = all new cases during a specified time period  
    
    - &lt;ins&gt;denominator&lt;/ins&gt; = all individuals at risk in the specified population at the start of the specified time period (does NOT account for deaths due to other causes)  
    
    - ranges from 0 to 1 (a.k.a., “incidence proportion”)  
    
    - like prevalence, is a proportion and therefore has no units (but only makes sense if you specify the time period of observation, e.g., % per year)  
    
    

---

## Incidence Density &lt;hr/&gt;

- Incidence density:

    - in a specified population consisting of at risk individuals over a specified period of observation, more precisely quantifies the person-time at risk  
    
    - &lt;ins&gt;numerator&lt;/ins&gt; = all new cases during a specified time period  
    
    - &lt;ins&gt;denominator&lt;/ins&gt; = the sum, over all individuals in the population, of time at risk until the event of interest, death, loss to follow-up, the end of the study, or when they are no longer at risk for whatever reason  
    
    - not a proportion; range depends on the units of person-time (0 to infinity)  
    
    - &lt;mark&gt;accounts for death from other causes!&lt;/mark&gt;



---

## Incidence: Which Denominator? &lt;hr/&gt;

- To understand the difference between cumulative incidence and incidence density, let's return to our imagined study of people living with HIV/AIDS at risk for _Pneumocystis_:  

    - 50 high-risk subjects enrolled at the start of a two-year observation period  
    
    - cases of PCP each receive 3 weeks of antibiotic treatment (red dots and lines on plots)  
    
    - incomplete follow-up (abbreviated grey lines on plot)
    
    - towards end of study, some subjects started on _Pneumocystis_ prophylaxis (blue lines on plot)  



---

## Cohort of Patients at Risk for _Pneumocystis_ &lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;img src="measures_of_disease_in_epidemiology_2019_bjk_files/figure-html/reprint_pcp_study-1.png" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



---

## Cohort of Patients at Risk for _Pneumocystis_: Cumulative Incidence &lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;img src="measures_of_disease_in_epidemiology_2019_bjk_files/figure-html/pcp_incid_proportion-1.png" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---

## Cohort of Patients at Risk for _Pneumocystis_: Incidence Density &lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;img src="measures_of_disease_in_epidemiology_2019_bjk_files/figure-html/pcp_incid_density-1.png" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



---

## Incidence: Which Denominator? &lt;hr/&gt;

- cumulative incidence of _Pneumocystis_ versus incidence density:

    - if the end of the grey line is death / loss to follow-up, how does incidence density compare to annual cumulative incidence?

    - if you don’t count time on prophylaxis or treatment antibiotics as “time at risk”, how does the incidence density compare to the annual cumulative incidence?  




---

## Notes on Population at Risk &lt;hr/&gt;

- In a population, individuals are at risk of disease if they: 

    - (1) do not have the disease at baseline  
    
    - (2) are capable of developing the disease(e.g., have the organ of interest; have not been successfully immunized against the disease;haven’t developed lifelong immunity)  
    

- The difference between cumulative incidence and incidence density is that the latter attempts a more precise quantification of population at risk -- it’s harder to evaluate, but more informative if you can.




---

## Notes on Person-Time &lt;hr/&gt;

- To improve precision of risk estimate (&lt;ins&gt;incidence density&lt;/ins&gt;), we measure:  

    - population at risk of outcome  
    
    - actual time at risk (during which outcome could)

- **Person-time**:  

    - denominator for incidence density  
    
    - the product of population at risk and time at risk (e.g., patient-months)



---

## Beware the Phrase “Incidence Rate”! &lt;hr/&gt;

- “Incidence rate” is used to mean two different things:

    - number new cases / number population at risk @ start (short) time interval (e.g., “annual incidence rate” to mean cumulative incidence over one year)  
    
    - number new cases / person-time at risk (i.e., incidence density, the precise rate)

- HIV in Rakai, Uganda 1994-2003*:

    - intensive “ABC” intervention (Abstinence, Be faithful, Condoms)
    - prevalence declined, but incidence remained constant at 1.5% per year
    - what happened?

# Inference from Epidemiologic Measures



---

## Basics of Study Types &lt;hr/&gt;

- We want to understand the relationship between risk factors (exposures) and disease (outcomes). For example, between CD4 count and PCP in HIV.

- To calculate incidence need to know how many are in a population:

    - randomized trials: pick the population, randomize, control the treatment, and measure the outcome
    - cohort studies: pick the population, divide into preselected exposure (treatment or risk factor) groups, and measure the outcome

- But do NOT know this generally in case control studies: pick the cases and control groups, then measure rates of exposure (do NOT know how many in population).

## Relative Risk (RR) &lt;hr/&gt;

- Compares risk between two groups of people:

    - if 2 in 10 are cured in the control group and 3 in 10 in the treatment group, the RR is (2/10)/(3/10) = 0.66 (i.e. 0.33 less likely to have the disease after treatment) 
    - can also be calculated as the inverse: if 3 in 10 are cured in the treatment group and 2 in 10 in the control group, the RR is (3/10)/(2/10) = 1.5 (i.e. 0.5 times more likely to be cured if treated)

---

## Absolute Risk (AR) &amp; Reduction (RD) &lt;hr/&gt;

- Absolute risk (AR): risk of developing a given disease over a period of time

    - this is the incidence!!!
    - if you have a 1 in 10 chance of developing skin cancer in your lifetime, you are said to have a 10% absolute risk

- risk difference (RD): difference in risk between the treatment/ exposure group and the control group

    - if 2 in 10 are cured in the control group and 3 in 10 in the treatment group, the RD is 3/10 – 2/10 = 10%

---

## Number Needed to Treat (NNT) &lt;hr/&gt;

- Number needed to treat (NNT): Number of patients who need to be treated for one person to benefit from the treatment  (= 1/RD)

    - using RD numbers above, NNT = 1/RD = 1/0.1 = 10
    - in this example, you need to treat 10 people to prevent one bad outcome

- Return to example of CD4 count and PCP… imagine a pill that can maintain CD4 count above 250… what’s the NNT to prevent one case of PCP?

    - RR = (26 / 50) / (2 / 50) = 13
    - RD = (26 / 50) - (2 / 50) = 0.48
    - NNT = 1 / 0.48 = 2.08

---

## 2x2 Table: Calculation for Case-Control &lt;hr/&gt;

- Odds Ratio (OR)= (A/C)/(B/D) = AD / BC

- risk difference (RD) = not appropriate to calculate

- Number Needed to Treat (NNT) = not appropriate to calculate

- #################### add table

---

## Utility of Odds Ratio (OR) &amp; Case-Control &lt;hr/&gt;

- if the disease incidence is low, then:

- A + B ~ B &amp; C + D ~ D

- RR = (A / A + B) / (C / C + D) ~ (A / B) / (C / D) = AD / BC = OR

- OR will be close to RR if outcome occurs infrequently (&lt;15%).

- If outcome is more common, OR will differ increasingly from RR:

## Measures of Disease in Clinical Epidemiology &lt;hr/&gt;

- Distribution of data determines how we describe them: mean and SD vs median and IQR.

- Prevalence is determined by incidence and survival time.

- Incidence density best accounts for time at risk for disease.

- Relative risk (RR) and odds ratio (OR) are measures of a difference between the incidence of the outcome for two or more exposures or treatments.

- RR and OR approximate each other when outcome is rare.

- NNT can be a clinically useful number.
